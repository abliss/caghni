It differs in omitting the [[Interface:Law of the excluded middle|law of the excluded middle]]. This interface contains one axiomization of intuitionistic logic.

# == Well-formed formulas ==
# 
# We first introduce the kind of [[w:well-formed formulas|well-formed formulas]] and a few variables for this kind.
kind (formula)
tvar (formula p q r s)
# 
# == Connectives ==
# Although it is possible to define intuitionistic logic with a single (complicated) connective, or with as few as three of the usual connectives, here we take implication, disjunction, conjunction, and negation as primitive:
# 
term (formula (¬ p)) # Negation
term (formula (→ p q)) # Implication
term (formula (∨ p q)) # Disjunction
term (formula (∧ p q)) # Conjunction
# 
# == Inference rule ==
# 
# The one rule is [[w:modus ponens|modus ponens]]:
stmt (applyModusPonens () (p (→ p q)) q)
# 
# == Implication ==
# 
# The first two of the [[Interface:Standard axioms of propositional logic]] serve as our axioms governing implication:
# 
stmt (Simp () () (→ p (→ q p)))
stmt (Frege () () (→ (→ p (→ q r)) (→ (→ p q) (→ p r))))
# 
# == Disjunction ==
# 
# For disjunction, we assume the ability to introduce a left hand or right hand side to any proposition:
stmt (DisjunctionLeftIntroduction () () (→ p (∨ q p)))
stmt (DisjunctionRightIntroduction () () (→ p (∨ p q)))
# 
# and the following form of disjunction composition:
stmt (DisjunctionCompositionAxiom () () (→ (→ p r) (→ (→ q r) (→ (∨ p q) r))))
# 
# == Conjunction ==
# 
# A conjunction implies either of its propositions:
stmt (ConjunctionLeftElimination () () (→ (∧ p q) q))
stmt (ConjunctionRightElimination () () (→ (∧ p q) p))
# 
# and can be derived from its propositions:
stmt (ConjunctionRightIntroduction () () (→ p (→ q (∧ p q))))
# 
# == Negation ==
# 
# If an antecedent implies both a consequent and its negation, we can infer the negation of the original statement.
stmt (ProofByContradiction () () (→ (→ p q) (→ (→ p (¬ q)) (¬ p)))) # *2.65 in Principia
# 
# From a contradiction, anything follows. This is also known as the [[w:Principle of explosion|principle of explosion]]. The presence of this axiom distinguishes intuitionistic logic from [[w:Minimal logic|minimal logic]].
stmt (Explosion () () (→ p (→ (¬ p) q))) # *2.24 in Principia
#
# == Truth ==
#
# Although ghilbert can, basically, define truth and falsity in terms of the above concepts, it doesn't appear to have the ability to give a notation for truth (⊤) or falsity (⊥) without an additional axiom. We adopt an axiom that asserts that ⊤ holds, which is enough (⊥ can be defined in terms of ⊤).
term (formula (⊤))
stmt (True () () (⊤))
# 
# == Biconditional ==
# Note that biconditional can be defined in terms of conjunction and implication, so an axiom
# is not necessary to introduce it; Ghilbert's defthm mechanism is powerful enough. See
# [BiconditionalJust] for the theorem justifying the definition.
